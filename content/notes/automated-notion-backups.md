Yesterday, Notion was down for hours and it got me searching for available automated backup options.

After researching a lot, I came through a [Medium article](https://medium.com/@arturburtsev/automated-notion-backups-f6af4edc298d) by Artur Burtsev.

It explained how to setup automatic regular backup of your entire Notion account with GitLab.

After experimenting a bit, I was able to successfull set up the automation.

And, it's working perfectly. üòç
